## About Me
My journey into data analysis began during my undergraduate studies in Economics, where I frequently found myself drawn to the analytical aspects of my coursework and projects. This curiosity deepened during my MPhil research, where I experienced firsthand the power of data in uncovering insights and shaping understanding. What started as an academic interest gradually evolved into a passion for research and data-driven storytelling. Although I briefly considered pursuing a PhD to continue this exploration, I realized that what I truly wanted was to engage with real-world data ‚Äî particularly in the contexts of economics, business, and market analysis. This decision was driven by my desire to build practical experience and create impactful work that reflects current, real-time dynamics.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I‚Äôve had exposure to tools like R and SPSS, especially during my econometrics coursework, and worked extensively with Excel during my internship at Nestl√©. However, recognizing the growing demand for versatile, market-ready skills, I took the initiative to strengthen my toolkit. I began learning Python, SQL, and Tableau through self-paced, online courses, appreciating the flexibility and real-world relevance they offered. Regular practice and project-building have since become part of my routine, allowing me to continuously improve and apply what I learn.

Outside of technical skills, I‚Äôve cultivated a disciplined, self-motivated approach to work ‚Äî shaped by a deep commitment to structured growth, focus, and consistency. Even when faced with complex or demanding projects, I‚Äôve learned to stay persistent, treating each challenge as an opportunity to improve and push my capabilities further.

I‚Äôm deeply committed to building a meaningful career in data analysis, and I bring both seriousness of purpose and a genuine enthusiasm to contribute to this ever-evolving field. I love staying updated with technological advancements, especially in areas like AI, and I‚Äôm always excited to explore new frontiers in data, learning, and innovation. My strong communication skills, analytical mindset, and eagerness to learn position me well for roles that combine technical analysis with practical impact.
This portfolio reflects my growth so far and marks the beginning of a journey I‚Äôm eager to continue ‚Äî as a student, a contributor, and a disciplined analyst ready to make a difference.
